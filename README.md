# Cheddar Defi Farm
A Defi token and farm on NEAR. Cheddar is a fun way for NEAR users to collect, swap and send Cheddar. To get Cheddar you can swap NEAR and stake it in the farm to stack even more Cheddar. Cheddar will also include a DAO (Phase II) where users can lock Cheddar to receive governance tokens to participate in the development process while earning additional rewards.

## How to use Cheddar
Alice swaps 5 NEAR for 100 Cheddar(CHDR), she then stakes them in the cheddy farm and earns more cheddar. Alice wants to make the most of the cheddy she's stacked, so locks some in the CHDR Boardroom this provides her with CHDR shares where she can take an active role in helping govern the CHDR ecosystem while earning CHDR and NEAR as a member. 

Bob knows alice and wants to join in on the fun he swaps NEAR for CHDR and stakes it in the farm, but Bob is not interested in being a board member so he farms and HODL's CHDR for a while and then swaps it back to NEAR.

## Where else can I use Cheddar?
As the NEAR ecosystem continues develop and more DEFI apps come one line the cheddy team will work with other defi devs to find fun and useful ways to use and farm CHDR.

The Cheddar defi app is comporised of and makes use of existing NEAR ecosystem applications:

- 1 BerryClub
- 2 BerryFarm
- 3 NEAR Swap / Banana Swap
- 4 SputnikDAO

The team behind Cheddar is anonymous, we hope Cheddar is fun and can be easily forked as a base for additional DEFI apps on NEAR.

## Technical Specs

### Cheddar Token (CHDR)
Cheddar will using the NEP112 for the Cheddar Token (CHDR), Cheddar Farm Token (CHDRLP) and Cheddar governance token (CHDRG)

#### Initial Circulating Supply 60,000 CHDR
- 5000 NEAR Swap
- 5000 Early Addopter Swap
- 50,000 Cheddar Farm

### Swap
Initally Cheddar will use a forked repo of BerrySwap and then will be migrated to NEARSwap once live.

#### Cheddar Swap Early Adopter
An early adopter pool will be seeded with 5000 chdr. Early adopters will to swap 1 NEAR to 100 Cheddar until the pool is exhausted and then the normal swap mechanism will need to be used.

### Farm
The Cheddar farm will use a forked repo of the BerryClub farm. The farm will allow you to stake Cheddar and in turn receive CHDRLP. The CHDRLP tokens will then be used to farm more cheddar based on your overal percentage of the Cheddar farm.

The pool will distribute 50,000 CHDR tokens starting with 5,000 CHDR and decrease 25% after/every 30 days.

#### Tokens
- Cheddar 
- Cheddar LP (No use outside of the farm)

### Governance DAO (Phase II)

The governance will use a forked repo of the Sputknik DAO to govern cheddar development and to distribute rewards. To participate in governance cheddar holders will have to stake and lockup cheddar for a minimum of 1 year, the more cheddar locked the more goverance tokens recieved.
Swapped or farmed Cheddar coins can be staked and locked in the DAO to earn governance tokens.

#### Tokens
- CHDR
- CHDRG
