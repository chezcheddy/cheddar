# Cheddar Defi Farm
A Defi token and farm on NEAR. Cheddar is a fun way for NEAR users to collect, swap and send Cheddar. To get Cheddar you can swap NEAR and stake it in the farm to stack even more Cheddar. Cheddar will also include a DAO (Phase II) where users can lock Cheddar to receive governance tokens to participate in the development process while earning additional rewards.

The Cheddar defi app is comporised of and makes use of existing NEAR ecosystem applications:

- 1 BerryClub
- 2 BerryFarm
- 3 NEAR Swap / Banana Swap
- 4 SputnikDAO

The team behind Cheddar is anonymous, we hope Cheddar is fun and can be easily forked as a base for additional DEFI apps on NEAR.

Cheddar will using the NEP112 for the Cheddar Token (CHDR), Cheddar Farm Token (CHDRLP) and Cheddar governance token (CHDRG)

#### Initial Circulating Supply 60,000 CHDR

- 5000 Early Addopter Swap
- 50,000 Cheddar Farm

### Swap
Initally Cheddar will use a forked repo of BerrySwap and then will be migrated to NEARSwap once live.

#### Cheddar Swap Early Adopter
An early adopter pool will be seeded with 5000 chdr. Early adopters will to swap 1 NEAR to 100 Cheddar until the pool is exhausted and then the normal swap mechanism will need to be used.

### Farm
